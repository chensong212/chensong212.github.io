If we use the vscode to debug, but the program requires an input file, then it will wait and never reach the break point. For example, we start in shell like

> "./a.out 1 test1.txt"

We have to type the arguments in "launch.json" file in the following manner:
> "args": ["<", "${workspaceFolder}/test1.txt"],


where the '${workspaceFolder}' can be replaced by absolute path like:
> /home/songchen/Downloads/sparta-master/examples/
